I’m [Will(iam) Chan][1], a peripatetic hacker who often visits San Francisco. I love [pandas][2] and penguins. Sometimes I write code. Currently Google employs me on a part-time (20%) basis to work on [SPDY][3] and [HTTP/2.0][4]. I represent the [Chromium project][5] in IETF's [httpbis working group][6]. I've been a member of the Chromium project since 2009. In that time, I've mostly focused on the Chromium [network stack][7], primarily from a web performance perspective, but I also helped port Chromium to Linux. In my majority time, I conduct quality control on San Francisco bars, travel around in search of adventure, and try to make a positive impact on the world while having fun doing so. I'm having a lot of fun.
